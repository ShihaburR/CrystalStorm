Crystal Storm - a 2D platform game created via CityEngine provided by City University London

The CityEngine is a wrapper around JBox 2D, a 2D physics engine

This was a project for Programming in Java module

Here is a showcase video of the basis of the game on Youtube:

What I made:

Built a 2D game via the engine provided

Created classes for:

Player's character/Spaceship

Enemies with basic automation and collisions with Player

Collectable objects

File I/O

Save and load your current state within the game.

Your high scores are recorded on a txt file.

Classes with inheritance from superclasses and abstract methods for easier implementation of multiple levels.

Built Javadoc through an IDE (Intellij)

Implemented sound within the levels via CityEngine and exception handling.

Created GUI forms via the IDE and implementing ActionListeners to respond to mouse input.
