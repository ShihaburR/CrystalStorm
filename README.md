# Crystal Storm  
A 2D platform game created via CityEngine provided by City University London
- The CityEngine is a wrapper around JBox 2D, a 2D physics engine
## This was a project for Programming in Java module
### The objective of this project  
* To have a 2D game, that has at least 4 bodies (characters/items/objects) that have collision events and individual properties e.g. health, score. The game must consist of 3 levels, each different from each other and must implement your own feature e.g. highscore, sound, Main menu etc.
* The Javadoc can be viewed [here](https://shihaburr.github.io/CrystalStorm/)
* Here is a showcase video of the basis of the game on YouTube: https://youtu.be/lQz8gc92XB8

## Outline of what I did:

* Built a 2D game via the engine provided
* Created classes for:
    * Player's character/Spaceship
    * Enemies with basic automation and collisions with Player
    * Collectable objects
* File I/O
    * Save and load your current state within the game.
    * Your high scores are recorded and viewed via a txt file.
* Classes with inheritance from superclasses and abstract methods for easier implementation of multiple levels.
* Built Javadoc through an IDE (Intellij)
* Implemented sound within the levels via CityEngine and exception handling.
* Created GUI forms via the IDE and implementing ActionListeners to respond to mouse input.
